Hello Everyone! I divided our GUI part to be 4 tasks:
1. plot x axis view in Matplotlib 
2. plot y axis view in Matplotlib
3. Embed matplotlib graphs into Tkinter
4. Load DICOM and patient info into Tkinter

Jane and Jin are trying to figure our how to plot x and y axis view.
Tenzin will do the embedding part.

This videos are about embedding for your reference:

By the way, I've tried some coding, but it doesn't work. You can see the class embed_mat.
I hope we can do the whole project in Object oriented form. And please write description to let others understand your code.
If anyone want to make modification, you can create another branch, if we all agreed than merge to the master branch.

We are a great team! We can do very well for this project!
