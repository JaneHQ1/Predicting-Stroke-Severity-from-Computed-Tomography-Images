Jane:
I read the basic logic of representing 3D volumn through a 2D image, but do not quite understand so far.
I think we need to use Vessel. What is vessel?
It is the x,y,z axis for each pixel on each slice.

Jin:
There are say 160 slices, which means we only have 160 pixels in column, but there are 250 pixels in row. 
Do we need to make 160 pixels to 250 pixels? How?

We understood the logic under 2D to 3D. It is simply 3 calculations:
Conversion from 2D to 3D
Voxel (x, y, z) = Image Plane Position + Row change in X + column change in Y
Where Row change in X = Row vector * Pixel size in X direction * 2D Point location in X direction
Column change in Y = Column vector * Pixel size in Y direction * 2D Point location in Y direction

Having got 3D volumn, how to convert to x,y views?

Read, try and understand the code in web:

Successfully plot the 3D image.
Had a breif discussion with supervisor. He doesn't recommend resampling, but image interpolation.
Jane Read through the paper about an optimisation method for slice interpolation of medical images.

Jin is trying to find the tools to do interpolation.
numpy.interp in python will work in interpolation
